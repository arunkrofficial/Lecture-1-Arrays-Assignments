# Coding Assignment Readme

This repository contains the solutions to a set of coding questions implemented in JavaScript. Each question has its own JavaScript file with a corresponding README section explaining the problem statement and the approach taken to solve it.

## Questions

1. **Two Sum**
   - File: `twoSum.js`
   - Description: Given an array of integers and a target value, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target. Returns the indices of the two numbers.
   - Example:
     Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
     Output: [0, 1]

2. **Remove Element**
   - File: `removeElement.js`
   - Description: Given an array of integers and a value, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length of the array.
   - Example:
     Input: nums = [3, 2, 2, 3], val = 3
     Output: 2

3. **Search Insert Position**
   - File: `searchInsert.js`
   - Description: Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index where the target value would be inserted into the array. If the target is already present, return its index.
   - Example:
     Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 5
     Output: 2

4. **Plus One**
   - File: `plusOne.js`
   - Description: Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, increment one to the integer and return the resulting array.
   - Example:
     Input: digits = [1, 2, 3]
     Output: [1, 2, 4]

5. **Merge Sorted Array**
   - File: `mergeSortedArray.js`
   - Description: Given two sorted arrays and their lengths, merge the second array into the first array as one sorted array in non-decreasing order.
   - Example:
     Input: nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], m = 3, nums2 = [2, 5, 6], n = 3
     Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

6. **Contains Duplicate**
   - File: `containsDuplicate.js`
   - Description: Given an array of integers, determine if any value appears at least twice in the array.
   - Example:
     Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
     Output: true

7. **Move Zeroes**
   - File: `moveZeroes.js`
   - Description: Given an array of integers, move all zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
   - Example:
     Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
     Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

8. **Set Mismatch**
   - File: `setMismatch.js`
   - Description: Given an integer array, find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing.
   - Example:
     Input: nums = [1, 2, 2, 4]
     Output: [2, 3]

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the JavaScript files for the questions you want to test.
2. Open the JavaScript files and modify the input values if desired.
3. Run the JavaScript files in a Node.js environment.
4. The output will be displayed in the console.
